# Mortal-CSD
Recreated the original Mortal Kombat game from scratch, in C++. 
The purpose was the CS-454 course's main project (Development of intelligent interfaces and games: https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy454/). 
Originally there were 2 more collaborators in a private repository but i made this public copy for CV purposes (thus the work shown here is roughly 1/3 mine).
