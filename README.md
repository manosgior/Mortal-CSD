# Mortal-CSD
A version of the game "Mortal Kombat" coded in C++ using the Allegro graphics library (featuring characters Subzero and Scorpion).
The game was created as the main project of the undergraduate course CS-454 (Development of intelligent interfaces and games: https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy454/). 

The team consisted of three members (Emmanouil Giortamis https://github.com/manosgior, Georgios Lydakis https://github.com/geomlyd and Anastasios Livanidis https://github.com/AlivasGR) and the work was more or less equally distributed. This repo is a public read-only copy of the original, created for showcasing
examples of our work for CV purposes.
